PROJECT TITLE: Zombie Identifier Program
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This project is designed to analyze sick peoples data from the user and then figure out for potential zombies. It takes in data from the user through JOptionPane prompts and writes all this data neatly to a file. After all this data is taken in it allows the user to view it neatly in a canvas GUI. There are different buttons allowing the user to analyze the data differently like potential zombies, patient zeros, or just a view of all the data collected. It is very neat in its viewing with proper grammer to make it easy for the user to read.
